# ANANTA - Organ Donation Website

ANANTA is a medical website, with a primary focus to tackle the shortage of organ donation in India. Donating organs is the greatest gift that you can give. It gives someone a second chance at life.

## Overview

According to official government data, thousands of patients in India die each year due to the shortage of organ donations. The numbers speak for themselves:
- An estimated 1.8 lakh people suffer from renal failure annually, but only around 6,000 renal transplants are performed.
- About 25-30 thousand liver transplants and 50 thousand heart transplants are needed annually, but the numbers performed are much lower.

ANANTA's bidirectional approach aims to address this issue:
- Increasing the number of donors.
- Reducing the demand by promoting healthy living.

## Features

- Myth Debunking Section: Our website features a section that aims to debunk myths present in the society and educate people about organ donation.
- 24/7 Medical Expert Consultation: We offer 24/7 medical expert consultation to our donors. We help resolve any queries regarding organ donation, provide tips to remain healthy during and after donation, and offer advice on precautions needed to be taken.
- Education Section: Our website has an education section that provides detailed information about different organ donation procedures, their side effects, and other health tips to ensure a smooth and healthy recovery.
- Health Section: This section of our website provides personalized yoga, exercise, and diet plans based on individuals' BMI to help them stay healthy and active throughout their lives.
